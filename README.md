# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

The code shown here creates an email for a student based on their first and last name entered by the user and a random 4 digit number. Then the school addreess is added as well. The data is stored as a tuple  and then saved to a file. That file is then sorted alphabetically.

I wrote this software to familiarize myself with writing java code and working with multiple java files. It was also an opportunity to learn how to import jar files and use them in my code.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used the java language in VS Code and inlcuded the javatuple jar file for storing the information about the user and the account as a tuple. I also imported the java util library.

# Future Work

I need to improve the sorting of the email list. Currently it reads the file and sorts it every time a new entry is added. I would like for it to insert the data into the correct spot to begin with.
